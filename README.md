# TCGCatch
**This is a template, the project is just initialized.**

***TCGCatch*** is an web application which wants to provide a social factor to the **Pok√©mon TCG World**, the idea in this is to make a social web based on every user having a personal profile where they can **register** which cards of **every existent set** do the have, with the possibility to insert the amount of copies they have of one specific card, and connecting to ***CardMarket*** to make possible know the medium price of every card.

***TCGCatch*** also wants to users **share their profiles**, **chat** with friends or other users and **share their collection**, having the possibility to ***create custom albums to share to the community*** *(for example, a "Selling/Tradeable cards" album)*.
